# pipeform

## Introduction

`pipeform` is a TUI for Terraform runtime progress.

## Usage

`pipeform` as its name indicates, shall be preceded by `terraform` run, through a pipe (`|`). Only the following `terraform` commands are supported:

- `terraform refresh -json`
- `terraform plan -json`
- `terraform apply -auto-approve -json`

Note that all the commands must have the `-json` flag specified, as the tool is built on top of the [Terraform machine-readable UI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/machine-readable-ui).

Example:

## Install

```shell
go install github.com/magodo/pipeform@main
# or GOBIN=/usr/local/bin/ go install github.com/magodo/pipeform@main
```

## Timing CSV File

The tool will generate a CSV file for further analysis/visualization by specifying the `--time-csv=<path>` option.

A taste of the output:

```csv
Start Timestamp,End Timestamp,Stage,Action,Module,Resource Type,Resource Name,Resource Key,Status,Duration (sec)

```

## FAQ

### How to use in CI?

By default, `pipeform` requires a [`tty`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pty.7.html) to make the UI work, which is unavailable in most CI systems (e.g. Github Action [has no tty](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/241)). To support this environment, the tool comes with an option `--plain-ui`, which will print out logs similar to the `terraform` default logs, except for the operations, it will prefix with a progress indicator.

[Example](https://github.com/magodo/pipeform/actions/runs/12745773365/job/35520444647).

### How to copy output variables?

In a successful run, the tool will end up at the `SUMMARY` stage, that displays a table of output variables defined. Users can select any of the output variables and press <kbd>c</kbd> to copy the value to the system clipboard.

Note that the clipboard functionality is only enabled when the tool is built properly (CGO might be required) on a supported platform. [Details](https://github.com/golang-design/clipboard?tab=readme-ov-file#platform-specific-details).

### What happens if terraform encounters any warning or error?

When the tool ends in either successful or failed state, the user is supposed to quit. Then the tool will print the Terraform JSON warning/error diagnostics to `stderr`.

Especially, if Terraform encounters an error, the tool will display an error indicator ❌ in the "state" section on the top left and stay in the terminated state.

### How to exit during operation?

There are two ways to exit during operation:
- Terminate `pipeform`
- Terminate `terraform`

Though, it is highly recommended **NOT** to terminate in the middle of the run.

#### Terminate `pipeform`

There is a key bind for terminating `pipeform`. When the user hit the key to quit, `pipeform` will quit immediately, which causes the pipe to close. Since `terraform` is still running and piping out logs, it will then hit a `SIGPIPE` signal, which `terraform` has no special handling and defaults to terminate `terraform` immediately.

#### Terminate `terraform`

Terraform can be terminated by interruption (<kbd>ctrl-c</kbd>). It even has *some* graceful handling for the interruption signal.

Whilst when using `pipeform`, since the terminal is turned into *raw* mode, pressing <kbd>ctrl-c</kbd> won't send the signal at all. Instead, you'll have to send the signal manually.

Under Linux you can do something as below:

```
$ # Find out the ppid of the `pipeform`
$ ps -ef | grep pipeform
magodo     88375    8823  1 11:05 pts/7    00:00:00 pipeform
magodo     89764   49424  0 11:05 pts/6    00:00:00 grep --color pipeform
$ # 8823 is the ppid of `pipeform`
$ # Use pstree to find the pid of the preceded `terraform`
$ pstree -lpT 8823
zsh(8823)─┬─pipeform(88375)
          └─terraform(88374)───terraform-provi(88695)
$ # 88374 is the pid of `terraform`
$ # Send the signal manully
$ kill -SIGINT 88374
```

After `terraform` being interrupted in the middle, `pipeform` won't just quit. Instead, it will respond to the diagnostics sent from `terraform` (once `terraform` finishes its *graceful* handling) and display the error indicators to users.

### Windows Powershell Doesn't Work?

Windows Powershell (at up to 5.1.22621.4391) does not pipe byte-streams like UNIX shells or the DOS Command interpreter. The Powershell also faces the same [issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1908), until v7.4.0-preview.4 (with this [PR](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/17857#issuecomment-1613864139) merged).

For users want to use `pipeform` under PowerShell, please ensure you have installed PowerShell newer than v7.4.0.

For users want to use `pipeform` under Windows Powershell, please invoke the DOS Command interpreter instead: `cmd "/c terraform.exe <command> -json | pipeform.exe"` (or just use the DOS Command interpreter instead).
